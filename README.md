### Tests
All of the testing done was using Red to Green refactoring.

Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc
I skipped testing on the sum_series due to its complexity and my lack of understanding of the 
mathematical nature of fibonacci & lucas. I had to do more research on both while that part of the
assignment was completed.
